TASK 4:
📊 Title: Analysis and Visualization of  Traffic Accidents 

🔍I have completed my fourth task which focused on analyzing and visualizing traffic accident data. Leveraging my skills in data analysis and visualization, I created three dynamic dashboards that shed light on crucial aspects of road safety.

🚦 In my first dashboard, I categorized accidents by weather and light conditions, the cause of the accident, severity of injuries sustained by the victims, and the area of occurrence of accident. Through bar graphs and highlight tables, I uncovered patterns revealing that surprisingly, most accidents occur in broad daylight under normal weather and light conditions. A significant number of accidents were concentrated near office areas, with injuries primarily non-life-threatening.

🚗 Moving to the second dashboard, I explored the correlation between weather, light conditions, the types of vehicles involved in the accident, types of collisons, and types of junctions accidents occured at. The visualization unveiled that the most common type of collision involves vehicles colliding upon other vehicles, predominantly between automobiles like cars/minivans and lorries, occurring frequently at Y-shaped junctions.

🛣️ Lastly, coming into road surface conditions, road alignment, and road surface types, my third dashboard offered critical insights into accident hotspots. Notably, accidents predominantly occurred on dry roads, with the road being tangential, flat, and made of asphalt.

🌟 My internship experience didn't just stop at creating dashboards; it involved keen observation and data interpretation. Through indepth analysis, I identified trends and patterns that can inform targeted interventions aimed at improving road safety.
